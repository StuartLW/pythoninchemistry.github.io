    "Parsons problems are useful problems to check if students undestand various aspects of code from pseudo code and process flow to indenting in python. Thanks go to the Edinburgh python in chemistry team for pointing these problems out at the first UK Python in Chemistry conference.  Deploying these used to be fairly easy thanks to a website where you could construct your problems and then embed them in your notebook, however this site now seems to have become defunct.  The original site and most deployed Parsons problems seem to be based on [The JS parsons code](https://github.com/js-parsons/js-parsons) available on github. Direct implementation in a Jupyter notebook however seems very hard due to the number of libaries that are required to make the javascript load correctly in a markdown cell.  The best solution therefore is to find an alternative host for embedding the problem and then bring the code in via an IFrame.  The system works on both Codepen and JSFiddle however the embedding from JSFiddle does not seem to render correctly in my hands.  There may be other possibilites and others may be able to solve the JSFiddle issue"
